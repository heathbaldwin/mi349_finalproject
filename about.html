        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Heath's Hoodies was founded by Heath Baldwin who is currently a student at Michigan State University and lives in
            East Lansing, Michigan. The company was originally started during the COVID-19 pandemic when Heath had alot of freetime 
            on his hands and decided to start a small business making custom embroidered hoodies and clothing items. Heath first 
            bought a small custom emvroidery machine and then scaled his business to the point where we needed to purchase a much larger 
            and expensive Brother-1900 machine. Heath Hoodies now is hoping to soon fully transition themselves from Etsy to their own 
            custom designed site in the next couple months and this is the first step. Enjoy the site!
